1. how many labels in a node node01 ?
    >> kubectl get nodes <node_name> --show-labels
2. set labeb to node01 with clour=blue
    >> kubectl label nodes node01 colour=blue
3. Create a new deployment named blue with the nginx image and 3 replicas.
    >> kubectl create deployment blue --image=nginx --replicas=3
4. Which nodes can the pods for the blue deployment be placed on?
    >> both control pane and node01 , coz no rule is set 
5. Set Node Affinity to the deployment to place the pods on node01 only.
    >> kubectl create deployment blue --image=nginx --replicas=3

6. Which nodes are the pods placed on now?
7. now create a deployment with another key that will allow pods to be deployed in master nodes ?
    >>hint check master node labels and use this key in deployment
